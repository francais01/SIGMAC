\chapter{What?}

If you're getting into a modern combat flight sim like BMS or DCS,
there's lots of great guides to learn how to fly:

and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqH078Ef0HENo01LF3xwIvA}{Crash Laobi},
just to name a few.
They'll show you how to start up a jet, take off, fly around
without ripping your wings off, shoot some weapons, and land.

But once you've got a decent grasp on how to fly a jet,
guides for \emph{employing} that jet seem harder to come by.
Once you know how not to crash the thing, you probably want to learn how to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Shoot other jets with missiles beyond visual range \acronym{(bvr)}
\item Dogfight other jets within visual range \acronym{(wvr)}
\item Defend yourself from surface-to-air missiles \acronym{(sam)}s
\item Put a bomb on a target
\item Form a \emph{flight} with other jets, as a wingman or as its lead
\item Communicate with other pilots and sound cool doing so
\end{itemize}
\dots all without taking a missile to the face.

Specific tactics vary from era to era and jet to jet,
but many of the same fundamentals have held for the last 50
years.\punckern\footnote{We'll try to discuss how evolving technology
enables newer tactics as we go.}
This won't be a comprehensive guide,
and contributions are welcome.
But it should outline the basics, and point you to resources where you can
learn more.
